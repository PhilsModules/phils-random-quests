in a hidden room behind the library
amidst the gravestones of the Forgotten Necropolis
in a bustling market square at noon
inside a giant hollow tree
in the sewers beneath the city
on a floating island drifting above the clouds
in a cave behind a waterfall
inside the belly of a dormant beast
at the crossroads where demons bargain
in a village that appears only once a year
in the royal gardens at midnight
inside a mirror maze
in a frozen wasteland to the north
at an oasis in the scorching desert
in the attic of a haunted mansion
inside a crystal cavern
on a ghost ship sailing the spectral seas
in a goblin camp under a bridge
at the ruins of an ancient observatory
inside a magical painting
in a dimension of pure shadow
at the lighthouse keeper's cottage
in a swamp filled with will-o'-wisps
inside a giant's abandoned boot
in the treasury of a dragon
at a temple dedicated to a forgotten god
in the tunnels of a giant ant colony
on a bridge spanning a chasm of fire
inside a clockwork tower
in a field of singing flowers
at the bottom of an ocean trench
in a cloud giant's castle
inside a mimic that looks like a house
in a labyrinth made of ice
at the site of a famous battlefield
in a gnome's workshop filled with ticking gadgets
inside a volcano about to erupt
in a hidden smuggler's cove
at a carnival run by fey creatures
in a forest where the trees walk
inside a bottle on a wizard's shelf
in a cursed mine shaft
at a shrine surrounded by eternal storms
in a city built on the back of a leviathan
inside a dreamscape
in a prison floating in the void
at the edge of the world
in a library with infinite hallways
inside a colossal skeleton
in a village made entirely of candy (it's a trap)
at the gates of the underworld
in a tower that grows downwards
inside a pearl giant clam
in a canyon where voices echo forever
at a tavern for time travelers
in a jungle of metal trees
inside a giant hourglass
on a moon rock
in a sanctuary for retired monsters
at a pool of liquid starlight
in a dungeon designed by a mad jester
inside the mind of a sleeping god
in a city of glass
at a graveyard for ships
in a valley of bones
inside a tornado
on a bridge made of moonlight
in a fortress of solitude used by a lich
at a hot spring inhabited by spirits
in a cavern full of glowing mushrooms
inside the heart of a machine
in a village cursed to relive the same day
at a monolith pulsating with energy
in a secret society's meeting hall
inside a dragon's egg
on a chessboard the size of a kingdom
in a forest of stone
at a lighthouse that guides souls, not ships
in a sanctuary hidden by illusions
inside a massive geode
in a swamp where silence kills
at a windmill that grinds dreams
in a city under a dome
inside a leviathan's stomach
on a floating debris field in space
in a garden of petrified people
at a forge powered by a star
in a tomb sealed for a thousand years
inside a giant's pocket
on an island that moves
in a maze of mirrors and smoke
at the center of a magical storm
in a void where gravity is optional
